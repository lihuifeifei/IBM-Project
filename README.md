Welcome! Please input your question!
p:   
Hello
m:
 Good day to you
p:
I want to use Portal, but it has a lot of problems.
m:
Is the general problematic transmission not met in the hardware, or the system version is incorrect, or does not meet the prerequisites?
p:
First consider the minimum requirements of the system.
m:
OK!
Please select the version you plan to use？
Portal9.0
Portal8.5
p: 
Portal9.0
m:
  What is your system used?
  Windows
  Linux
  AIX
p:
 Windows
m: (picture)
p:
The system is correct, look at other issues.
m:
Since there are no problems with the system, you should consider the prerequisites.
Successful execution of WebSphere Portal 9.0 requires the following three prerequisites:    
  1) Successful installation of WebSphere Application Server 8.55 or WebSphere Application Server 9.     
 2) Successful installation of IBM Installation Manager 1.8.5 and future fix packs.     
  3) Successfully install one of Java SDK 7, Java SDK 7.1 or Java SDK 8.
p:
I also meet the prerequisities requirements.
m:
Oh, my God, these are all fine. The most likely thing is that the hardware requirements are not met.
The hardware requirements for Portal 9.0 are as follows: 1) Disk space: It is recommended to install a minimum of 8 GB of free disk space
 2) Memory: At minimum load, WebSphere Portal can use 4GB of RAM and a remote database. In a production environment, 8GB is the best starting point for RAM. 
3) Processor: X86-64, IBM POWER series processor, System z processor 
4) Additional hardware requirements: Minimum 2 CPUs required to install IBM WebSphere Portal and IBM Web Content Manager.
p:
You are right, my problem is solved!
